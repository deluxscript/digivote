# DIGIVOTE - Decentralized Electronic Voting System

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

** Numerous updates to this repo will be ongoing until 03/05/2021 **

## Problem Statement:

Security of digital voting is a big concern, and this can affect the integrity of the democratic process. Voter fraud has also been an issue in some countries where digital voting has been used for this exercise whereby non-authenticated users are still permitted to vote, or the digital tool is being manipulated. This in general and more have put a dent on the democratic process.
